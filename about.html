    <h2>The Ancient Echoes Project</h2>
    <p>The value of culture is the measurement by which we can determine how people have changed over the years. It is
      easy to see this through stories about the history of building and defending the country, works about the precious
      qualities of the Vietnamese people, and the lessons that have been continued and developed that we have heard from
      our grandparents and parents. However, with the mindset of a young person in today's digital environment, these
      stories or lessons become somewhat dry, we can only feel from them the echoes from the past, reminding us how
      unique our country's culture is.</p>

    <p>In order to bring the learning of Vietnamese culture to be carried out through direct activities, “The Ancient
      Echoes” brings the experience of making traditional toys by hand, seemingly small but the cultural values are the
      most ordinary things, penetrating into our daily lives, even the toys of our childhood. Through the journey of
      preserving traditional values for generations, we also want to bring the previous and present generations together
      through these ancient toys and games that develop intelligence.</p>
